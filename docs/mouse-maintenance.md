# Mouse Maintenance & Switch Repair Guide

## Introduction
Mouse double-clicking issues are often caused by static electricity buildup, oxidizing switch contacts, or physical wear. Before buying a new mouse, try these maintenance steps.

## 1. Static Electricity Discharge
Sometimes, static buildup causes erratic signaling.
1. Unplug the mouse.
2. Click all buttons continuously for ~30 seconds.
3. Plug it back in and test.

## 2. Cleaning the Lens (Optical Sensor)
Cursor skipping? It's usually dust.
- Use a Q-tip dipped in **isopropyl alcohol (99%)**.
- Gently clean the sensor eye.
- **Do not** blow into it with your mouth (moisture makes it worse).

## 3. Fixing the "Double-Click" Issue (Advanced)
If your mouse registers two clicks instead of one, the microswitch (Omron/Kailh/Huano) leaf spring might be oxidation.

### Method A: DeoxIT / Contact Cleaner (No Soldering)
1. Disassemble the mouse shell to expose the switches (rectangular boxes).
2. Spray a **tiny** amount of contact cleaner into the switch plunger gap.
3. Click the switch rapidly to work the fluid in.
4. Let it dry for 10 minutes.

### Method B: Tensioning the Spring (Difficult)
1. Carefully open the microswitch housing (watch out for flying parts!).
2. Remove the copper leaf spring.
3. Gently re-bend the curve to increase tension.
4. Reassemble. **Warning:** This is very fiddly.
